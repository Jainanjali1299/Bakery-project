    <p>Start by making the cake and while it bakes, you can make the cream cheese frosting. See full recipe at the bottom of the post</p>
    <h2>Make the cake</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your cake pans and preheat the oven.</li>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together. Add oil.</li>

        <h2>Make the cream cheese frosting</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat butter and cream cheese together.</li>
            <li>Add powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Add vanilla and salt.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Assemble the cake</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set one cake layer on a plate with the flat side facing up
             (or, if your cake rose too much, cut its rounded top with a knife to make it flat)..</li>
            <li>Evenly spread a thick layer of the frosting over the cake to the edge.
             Top with the second cake layer, rounded side up.</li>
            <li>Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Products I use to make this cake</h2>
        <p>9-inch cake pans – these high quality cake pans help my layer cakes bake beautifully. 
            Some of you asked me on Instagram how come my cakes are so flat</p>
            <p>There are a few tricks for it, and you can read about 
            it in this helpful guide, but I’ll be honest that I don’t bother with this.
             I get good results with these cake pans, and if the cakes have a dome, I slice it off with a sharp knife. 
             It’s less trouble, and no one will notice.</p>
